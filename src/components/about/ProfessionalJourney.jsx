This inspired me to pursue a career where I could contribute to this positive change.

            I started my career working with local startups, developing solutions that addressed specific needs in the East African market. This early experience taught me the importance of building applications that are not only technically sound but also contextually relevant to the users they serve.

            As a full-stack developer, I've cultivated a holistic approach to software development. I believe in understanding both the technical architecture and the user experience deeply. This philosophy guides me to create solutions that are not only functionally robust but also intuitive and accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

            What drives me technically is the constant evolution of web technologies and the opportunity to leverage these advancements to create more efficient, scalable, and impactful applications. I'm particularly passionate about performance optimization and creating seamless experiences across different devices and connection speedsâ€”a critical consideration for applications serving the East African market.
